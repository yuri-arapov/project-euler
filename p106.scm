;; Let S(A) represent the sum of elements in set A of size n. We shall call it a
;; special sum set if for any two non-empty disjoint subsets, B and C, the
;; following properties are true:
;; 
;; S(B) â‰  S(C); that is, sums of subsets cannot be equal.
;; If B contains more elements than C then S(B) > S(C).
;; For this problem we shall assume that a given set contains n strictly
;; increasing elements and it already satisfies the second rule.
;; 
;; Surprisingly, out of the 25 possible subset pairs that can be obtained from a
;; set for which n = 4, only 1 of these pairs need to be tested for equality
;; (first rule). Similarly, when n = 7, only 70 out of the 966 subset pairs need
;; to be tested.
;; 
;; For n = 12, how many of the 261625 subset pairs that can be obtained need to be
;; tested for equality?
;; 
;; NOTE: This problem is related to Problem 103 and Problem 105.
